# LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions to LeetCode problems, organized by topic and difficulty. I'm solving these to improve my problem-solving skills and prepare for technical interviews and competitive programming contests.

#ðŸ“‚ Structure

The problems are categorized into folders based on topic or difficulty (or both), and each solution includes clean code with comments (where needed). Most solutions are written in **C++**.

## âœ… Topics Covered

- Arrays & Strings  
- Hashing  
- Sliding Window  
- Two Pointers  
- Binary Search  
- Linked Lists  
- Trees  
- Recursion & Backtracking  
- Dynamic Programming  
- Greedy  
- Graphs  
- Bit Manipulation  
- and more...

## ðŸ›  Languages Used

- (May add more languages later)

## ðŸš€ Progress

I'm actively solving problems and adding them here regularly.

- Easy: âœ…  
- Medium: âœ…  
- Hard: âœ…  

> You can sort or search by folder or filename to find specific problems.

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

- Only optimized or clean solutions are committed.
- Some problems may have multiple approaches or comments explaining the logic.
- I'm following up with contests and special sheets like [TLE Eliminators]
